-- The following data definition defines an organization's employee hierarchy.

-- An employee is a manager if any other employee has their managerId set to this employee's id. That means John is a manager if at least one other employee has their managerId set to John's id.

-- TABLE employees
--   id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
--   managerId INTEGER REFERENCES employees(id)
--   name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
-- Write a query that selects only the names of employees who are not managers.

SELECT name 
FROM employees
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT managerId 
  FROM employees
  WHERE managerId IS NOT NULL);
